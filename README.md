# React-Express Boilerplate

In the past, when I want to build a fullstack application, I would run two scripts - create-react-app and express-generator - to get a basic starting point for development. I found that I have wasted enough time deleting boilerplate code and not understanding webpack, so I have decided to spend a weekend building this boilerplate to help my development proceess going forward. 

Best of luck,

## Setup
To use this as boilerplate, you'll need to take the following steps:

* Don't fork or clone this repo! Instead, create a new, empty
  directory on your machine and `git init` (or create an empty repo on
  Github and clone it to your local machine)
* Run the following commands:

```
git remote add boilermaker https://github.com/ducvtrann/react-express-boilerplate.git
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```

Why? Because every once in a while, `boilermaker` may
be updated with additional features or bug fixes, and you can easily
get those changes from now on by entering:

```
git fetch boilermaker
git merge boilermaker/master
```
